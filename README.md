===========
why isnt this building?okay.please.what?
This is a repository where I put my solutions to 
[Practice-It](http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/practiceit) problems. If you
have suggestions on how to improve these solutions by making them more 
efficient, elegant, readable, etc don't hesitate to make a pull request.

Important
---------
I have been contacted by some professors letting me know that some of their
students are using these solutions and submitting them as their own work. If
you are given as homework to solve these problems, please do not copy these
solutions. Your professor is aware of this repository and you will be caught!
